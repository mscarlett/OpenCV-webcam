# OpenCV-webcam
This is sample code from my <a href="http://michaelscarlett.blog.com/2015/01/25/opencv-java-webcam-example/">blog post</a> on displaying a webcam image to the screen in Java using OpenCV. The version of OpenCV used is the one from the <a href="https://github.com/PatternConsulting/opencv">PatternConsulting/opencv</a> project so that the library can be included as a Maven dependency, however if you're using Windows then there are currently no binaries available and you'll have to include the jar manually. To setup this project, clone it to your desktop then import it into Eclipse as a Maven project.
